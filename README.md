## Walking Group: Iteration 1 User Stories

1. Create Account, Log-in, Log-out,
------------------------------------------
- As a new user, I want to be able to launch the app and signs up using my name, email, and enter a password.
    (Email addresses are used to uniquely identify accounts.)
- As a user, after logging in, if I close the app and relaunch it then the app remembers my credentials and automatically logs me in again. 
	(Suggestion: just store the token returned to you by the server).
- As a user, I can log out to have the app forget my login credentials so that the next time I launch it I am asked for my email address and password again.


2. Manage Account Monitoring
------------------------------------------
- As a user (such as a parent), I am able "monitor" the account of another user (such as my child).
- As a user, I am able to have 0 or more users monitoring me, and I may monitor 0 or more other users.
- As a user, I can list the users whom I monitor, and who monitors me.
    App must show me at least the name and email of the other account.
- As a user who monitors others, I can remove anyone from the list of users whom I monitor.
- As a user who is monitored by another user, I can remove anyone from the list of users who monitor me.
- As a user, I can add another user to the set of users I monitor (such as when monitoring my child).
    The child account must already exist and is identified by its email address.
- As a user, I can add another user to the set of users who monitor me (such as adding my parent).
    The parent account must already exist and is identified by its email address.


3. Create, View, and Join a Walking Group
------------------------------------------
- As a user, I can see on a map, centred on my GPS coordinates, locations (like schools) to which nearby walking groups around walk.
- As a user, I can create a new walking group by specifying the location (like a school) to which we will be walking, and one meeting place for the group. When creating it, I give the group a descriptive name.
- As a user, I can select an existing walking group from the map and join it.
- As a user, I can have any user I monitor (such as my child) join a walking group.
- As a user, I can leave any group I am part of, or remove a user I monitor (my child) from the group.
     (A user may be a member of any number of groups.)
- As a group leader, I can remove any user in my group from the group.

	 

General Notes:
- UI must be in a separate package from the data "Model".
- Use a singleton pattern to allow all parts of the UI to access the model.
- From any screen, the Android back button must do the "reasonable" thing.
- Strings shown to the user must be in string.xml

Iteration 2 User Stories
====================================

User Information
------------------------------------
* As a user of the system I want to be able to see and edit my own information so other users who can see it can better contact me.
  All of the additional information is optional, and includes: 
	- name, birth year & birth month, address, 
	- home phone, cell phone
	- email, 
	- current grade and teacher's name (which is meaningful only if I'm a student)
	- emergency contact info (free text which may include person's name, relationship to 
	      user, email, phone numbers, etc. This is only meaningful if I'm a student.)

* As a parent of a child using the system I want to be able to see and edit the information of anyone I monitor (my children), which includes the same type of information as entered about me (see above), so other users can better contact me or my child.


------------------------------------
Walking Groups
------------------------------------
* As a group leader, when I select a walking group I lead, I want to be able to see the names of users who are members in the walking group. Plus for each of those members I can see more in-depth info on all users who monitor them. I use this to remember the names of kids in my walking group, plus look up contact info of their parents whenever I need to contact them (such as for a problem related to their child, or planning a weekend BBQ with all members of the walking group and their parents).

* As a member of a walking group, when I select the group I am in I can see the names of users who are members in the walking group, plus for each of those members I can see more in-depth info on all users who monitor them. I use this to remember the names of other kids in my walking group, plus look up contact info of their parents whenever there is a problem and I need to contact them.

* As a parent with children in walking groups, when I select the group which my child is a member of, I can see the names of users who are members in the walking group, plus for each of those members I can see more in-depth info on all users who monitor them. I use this to know the names of other kids my child is walking with, plus look up contact info of their parents whenever there is a problem and I need to contact them.


------------------------------------
On Walk Features
------------------------------------
* As a member of a group, or a leader of a group, when I'm walking with the group I am able to start the app uploading my GPS location to the server. It uploads my location every 30 seconds so that those who monitor me (or who monitor members of my group if I am the leader) may know where I am. I am able to stop the uploading once I get to school, and the uploading automatically stops 10 minutes after I have reached school.

* As a parent with a child in a walking group, I use the in-app Parent's Dashboard feature, which shows a map, to see the last reported location of my child and the leader as they walk with the group. The parent's dashboard also allows me to see all my children (users I monitor) at once so I can, at a glance, know they are safe and walking it to school as expected. 

* As a parent using the parent's dashboard, for each user that I see on the map it indicates how long it has been since that user's latest location was updated. This helps me know if location data is still being received from the users or if they have gone offline.



------------------------------------
In-App Messages
------------------------------------
* As a user, I am able to view any messages which have been sent to me. I can see which messages are read vs unread. From Parent's Dashboard I can always see how many new messages are waiting for me, and easily view (at least unread) messages. App checks for new (or unread) messages every minute. This allows me to receive messages from my children, children in my group, or the leader of a group I'm a member of.

* As the leader of a walking group, I am able able to send out broadcast messages to all members of my group, and those who monitor members of my group. These messages are just plain text. I might use this to announce I am unable to go today (such as sick), or a reminder everyone of something (such as bring an umbrella for the rain expected later). While on the walk I might use this to notify all parents of members of my group that there is an issue, such as we were unable to get to class due to police incident, or being chased by a dog.

* As a child who walks with a walking group, when I am walking I am able to press a panic button and optionally enter a message (plain text) to indicate that I am having a problem on the walk (likely an emergency). This will notify all users who monitor me (my parents), plus the group leader of any groups I am in. It allows me to quickly report a problem so that I may receive help from them, or to let them know about an emergency. 

* As a child who walks with a walking group, when I am walking I am able to send a message (plain text) to all users who monitor me (my parents) and the group leader of any groups I am in. This allows me to let them know of something such as I'm running late, the group never showed up, or some other non-emergency situation. This allows me to use the app to communicate with my parents, but not send an emergency panic message.

========================

Gamification
---------------
- As a student, I want the app to reward me for how often I walk with my group. Each time I complete a 
  walk with my group I earn one or more points (each team decides how to reward users with points). 


- As a student (and possibly a group leader), I want to earn points each time I walk with my group. In 
  the app I can prominently see my current points that I can spend, and I can spend my points on in-app 
  rewards. In the app I can go look at my currently 'purchased' rewards, and up-coming rewards that I 
  could buy. Things I might want to spend points on include:
   * app customization, such as new backgrounds, new colour schemes, new in-app icons,
   * buying stickers in game to drag onto a virtual sticker book,
   * avatar icons and glorious titles like "dragon slayer" or "butterfly catcher",
   * or other ideas! 
(Teams can pick what reward structure they want to setup, be it one of these suggestions or something 
 else. You are encouraged to be creative and come up with ways to motivate the students. Rewards must be 
 at least as challenging to implement as an above suggestion. This is how the user will be motivated, so 
 make sure you draw the user in with this!)

   
- As a user, I can view a leader board showing the total number of points each user has earned over the 
  lifetime of using the app (not just the number of points they currently have to spend). The leader board 
  shows the first name and first letter of the last name for each user, along with how many points the 
  user has earned over their lifetime of using the app. The leader board shows all users (not just ones in 
  my walking group), and is sorted from highest-points to lowest points. It is fine if the leader board 
  only shows the top 100 users (or so) if that makes more sense from an app design point of view.

Permissions
-----------
- As a parent I want to approve or deny requests: 
   * to set my child as the leader of a walking group (likely when my child creates a group).
   * for my child join or leave a walking group.
   * for my child begin being monitored by another user
   * for my child stop being monitored by one of his/her current 'parents'
   
- As a leader of a group, I want to approve or deny requests:
   * for another user to take over leading my group
     (note that there is no requirement that the app support changing the leader of a group).
   * for users to join my group.

- As a user, I want to approve or deny requests:
	* for me to become a group leader.
	* for me to join or leave a walking group.
	* for another user to begin monitoring me.
[NOTE: Server creates all permission objects, so your app need not worry about what permission
 objects should be created for a given request. However, your app must correctly function
 when the server generates these permission objects.] 
  
- As a user, I can see all permission requests which have ever been sent to me. For each permission 
  request I can see the details of what action was being requested, and the status of that request 
  (approved, rejected, or pending). I can see which users approved or rejected the request.

In detail, when an API call is made to the server which would trigger an action which now requires 
permission, the server will create one Permission record.
   - A Permission record stores:
      - who requested the action
      - what action is being requested (X joining group Y, X being monitored by Y, etc).
      - status: accepted, rejected, pending
      - which users were asked to give permission for the action,
      - which users have accepted or rejected the request
   - A Permission record is status is:
      pending: if it is not yet accepted or rejected.
      rejected: if any of the users who are asked to give permission reject the request.
      accepted: if, for each set of users who need to grant permission, one user of that set grants 
      permission.
   - A Permission record may have multiple sets of users needing to give permission. For example, if 
     child A requests to monitor child B, then:
      - B will have to approve it, and
      - A will have to approve it (done implicitly by making the request), and
      - one of B's 'parents' will have to approve it.
   - Each user can see a list of Permission records which for which they were asked to give permission.
   - Once one user has accepted or rejected a request, no other users in that same user-set may accept 
     or reject the request. Though, they may still see the request for their reference.
   - In cases where nobody need be asked for permission (i.e., the current user, who initiated the 
     action, is sufficient for granting all required permissions) then the server completes the requested 
     change without generating a permission request or asking anyone (even the current user) for 
     permission.
